Introduction to project 0: Inaugural  Project

Considering a consumers maximization problem, we find the optimal consumption and labor-supply to be 1.183 and 0.382 respectively, with a utility of 0.172 given the parameters of the model and wage set equal to 1. Then we calculate total tax revenue for labor-supply elasticty of 0.3. We find total tax revenue to be 1629.8. For labor-supply elasticity of 0.1, we find optimal consumption and labor-supply to be 1.398 and 0.716 respectively, with a total tax revenue of 3196.3. Lastly, we find the optimal levels of standard labor income tax, top tax and the top tax cut-off bracket, to maximize tax revenue. We find  ____ ...
